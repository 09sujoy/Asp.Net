Our project is about online consultation from doctors. We have tried to demonstrate the basic functionalities of doctor appointments.
In our project, we have worked with three users. The functionalities of the users are defined below;
 
1) Patient: The user will be able to see the doctor list and could search the doctor according to their sickness. The user will also be able to see the appointment list of the doctor and could reserve an appointment for a consultation. While taking the consultancy from the doctor the user will interact with the doctor by sending messages. Furthermore, the user will be able to download the prescription of the doctor.

2)Doctor: The user will be able to see the appointment list of the patients. The user could also remove the appointments if he/she doesnâ€™t have enough time. The user will also be able to upload the schedule and the prescription.

3)Admin: Admin will be able to see the patients, and doctors if any problem arises or if any user needs to be removed. He will also be able to manage the appointment list according to the payment information. He can also ban a user depending on spam messages and attacking behaviour. The banned user could also interact with the admin to know the banning reason. If the doctor wants to modify his name, degree, and government-provided ID then the user should request the admin panel for modification. Moreover, if the doctor wants to change the email or phone number the user will receive an OTP from the admin.

In our project using these three users we want to provide a better online service to our client.
